# Introduction

Named after a famous artist Rene Magritte, who painted the famous 'ceci n'est pas une pipe' image, the `magrittr` / `dplyr` packages contains a suite of functions using pipes for data manipulation.

I had a friend at university who frequently bought pipe tobacco as apparently it is much cheaper than regular tobacco. Anyway, much like his smoking habit, `dplyr` can chain things together. In addition to this, it is relatively readable and interpretable in comparison to `data.table` (or at least to me). That isn't to say I don't like `data.table`, it has its place and advantages with larger data sets but I do not often work with such data sets that the efficiency gain outweighs the trade-off between readability. It is important to balance such things and to consider QC'ers or the possibility of someone taking over a piece of code from you.

# R pipe (\|\>)

The native pipe was introduced in R 4.1.0 and acts similarly to the forward pipe (`%>%`) in `magrittr`. Both pipes take in what is on the left-hand side and apply the function on the right-hand side. A number of pipes can be applied sequentially to give a chain of events.

## Native vs Magrittr

There are some subtle differences between the native and `magrittr` pipe, including operational efficiency/speed, bracket usage, placeholder syntax, etc. For example, using `rlang` we can see what is happening under the hood between the two pipes. I.e.,

The R native pipe:

```{r}
rlang::expr(x |> f())

```

Magrittr forward pipe:

```{r}

rlang::expr(x %>% f())


```

We can see that the native pipe is changing the structure (evaluating the expression as syntax) whereas the `magrittr` pipe is evaluated as a function call and thus is slightly slower.

```{r}

microbenchmark::microbenchmark("sqrt(4)" = sqrt(4),
                               "Native" = 4 |> sqrt(),
                               "Magrittr" = 4 %>% sqrt())
```

There is a wonderful answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67633022/what-are-the-differences-between-rs-native-pipe-and-the-magrittr-pipe) which goes through in more detail some of the differences.

Generally speaking though, if you're *really* concerned about speed you wouldn't use `dplyr`.

# Alternative pipes

## Magrittr

### Forward pipe (%\>%)

As briefly mentioned, the forward pipe from `magrittr` behaves similarly to the native pipe in R and allows you to apply potentially many functions in a sequence of code. It will take in values from the LHS and apply functions on the RHS. For example, here we are doing the following:

-   Select columns species, sepal length and petal length from `iris`
-   For the newly subsetted data, replace dots with underscores and make names lower case
-   display the first 6 rows of the data frame

```{r}

iris %>% 
  select(Species,Sepal.Length,Petal.Length) %>%
  rename_with(~tolower(gsub("\\.","_",.)), everything()) %>% 
  head()

```

### Assignment pipe (%\<\>%)

Typically after applying a series of functions we want to save the result. If you are writing back to the original object a quicker step than doing:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Create data frame of normally distributed values
df <- data.frame(col=rnorm(100,10,1))
# Remove values greater than 10
df <- df %>% filter(col<10)

```

is to simply use the assignment:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# Create data frame of normally distributed values
df <- data.frame(col=rnorm(100,10,1))
# Remove values greater than 10
df %<>% filter(col<10)

```

### Eager pipe (%!\>%)

The eager pipe evaluates the piped input at each step, you'll notice when the code below is run with the "lazy" forward pipe, messages appears in a backwards order.

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(42)
# Create main function with forward pipes
main_fun <- function() {
  cli::cli_progress_step(msg = "Running main function")
  sample(1:100,50,replace=T) %>% 
    fun1() %>% 
    fun2() %>% 
    fun3()
}
# Create sub functions
fun1 <- function(x){cli::cli_progress_step(msg = "Function 1");Sys.sleep(2); x*2}
fun2 <- function(x){cli::cli_progress_step(msg = "Function 2");Sys.sleep(2); x+5}
fun3 <- function(x){cli::cli_progress_step(msg = "Function 3");Sys.sleep(2); mean(x)}

# call main function
main_fun()



```

However, when applying the 'eager' pipe we see a more intuitive output which is useful for debugging as messages will appear in the order the functions are applied.

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(42)
# Create main function with eager pipes
main_fun <- function() {
  cli::cli_progress_step(msg = "Running main function")
  sample(1:100,50,replace=T) %!>% 
    fun1() %!>% 
    fun2() %!>% 
    fun3()
}
# Create sub functions
fun1 <- function(x){cli::cli_progress_step(msg = "Function 1");Sys.sleep(2); x*2}
fun2 <- function(x){cli::cli_progress_step(msg = "Function 2");Sys.sleep(2); x+5}
fun3 <- function(x){cli::cli_progress_step(msg = "Function 3");Sys.sleep(2); mean(x)}

# call main function
main_fun()



```

### Tee pipe (%T\>%)

A regular forward pipe will update the value of the expression on the LHS from expressions on the RHS and is performed sequentially. A useful, less well-known pipe is the 'Tee Pipe'. Similar to the Tee Pipe used by your local plumber to create a junction through a T shape, the Tee Pipe takes the input on the LHS and creates a junction to bypass functions which would normally terminate. A popular example is the use of `plot` with `colSums`

```{r,error=TRUE,warning=FALSE}

iris %>%
 select(Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width) %>%
 plot %>%
 colSums

```

The above code will produce an error as the plot command does not return anything and therefore `colSums` will throw an error. Instead we can use a Tee Pipe to pass the data with `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width` to both the `plot` and `colSums` argument.

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-width: 6.5
flowchart LR
  A[iris] --> B[select]
  B --> C{T}
  C --> D[plot]
  C --> E[colSums]
```

```{r}

iris %>%
 select(Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width) %T>%
 plot %>%
 colSums

```

This is a fairly trivial example but it does have its uses. By inserting a `print` command it can be used to help with debugging or we can save an object in the middle of pipes.

It should also be noted that the use of curly brackets will give the same result.

```{r}

iris %>%
  select(Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width) %>%
  {plot(.)
  colSums(.)}


```

What about the example below?

```{r}

iris %>%
  select(Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width) %T>%
  sqrt %>%
  colSums
```

You might be wondering why this appears to not work, shouldn't this output the square root and the column sums? It turns out that it works only when one of the operations does not return a value e.g. `plot()` and `print()` are used to generate outputs and therefore the function themselves returns `NULL`.

## Zeallot pipe (%\<-%)

The [zeallot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zeallot/zeallot.pdf) package contains pipes which allow for multiple assignment. The operator allows for the user to assign from LHS to RHS or RHS to LHS. A simple example below shows how I can assign values to `x` and `y`.

```{r}

c(3,4) %->% c(x,y)

c(x,y) %<-% c(3,4)


cat("x = ", x, "\ny = ", y)
 
 
```

```{r,eval=TRUE}

df1 <- 
  data.frame(
    subject_id = c("S001-0001", "S001-0002", "S001-0003"),
    Trt = c("Pembrolizumab", "Pembrolizumab", "nivolumab"),
    status = c(1,1,1),
    age = c(38,64,24),
    time = c(10,38,83)
    )

df2 <-
  data.frame(
    subject_id = c("S002-0001", "S002-0002", "S002-0003"),
    Trt = c("atezolizumab ", "Pembrolizumab", "atezolizumab"),
    status = c(1,1,1),
    age = c(24,67,12),
    time = c(34,92,145)
    )

# Create data.tables
purrr::map(mget(ls(pattern = '^df\\d+$')), as.data.table) %->%
          c(df1, df2)

# See result
list(df1,df2) %>% 
  lapply(\(x) class(x))

```
