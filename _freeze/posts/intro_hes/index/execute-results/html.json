It is important to note that a **secondary use** (and not primary) is for HES to be used for *research*. Whilst there are steps to clean and have some data quality, there are concerns by the research community regarding the quality, completeness and coverage of HES records.\n\nResults from a bibliometric analysis of 520 studies extracted from PubMed showed the growth of HES data usage in publications from 1996 to 2014 with 1 publication found in 1996 and 99 found in 2014.\\@ref(Chaudhry329) It is likely for this trend to continue as HES offers a vast amount of information about the population and is being linked to other national datasets such as ONS mortality resulting in increased applicability e.g. survival analysis. However, HES isn't without issues as it will be discussed later.\n\n![Cumulative growth of HES publications from 1996 to 2014](hes_pubs.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"815\"}\n\n# Annual HES data set\n\nAs mentioned, the primary purpose of HES is for hospital reimbursement. As such, each annual dataset is defined by the financial year (From 1 April to 31 March) and not by the calendar year.\n\n## The different data sets of HES\n\n\\[diagram of different data sets, subsets, etc\\]\n\n-   Admitted Patient Care (APC) - Details of episodes of care where a patient has been admitted into hospital (including regular day or night attending patients)\n\n-   Critical Care (CC) - A subset of APC data and consists of Adult Critical Care from 2008-09 onwards, with neonatal and paediatric CC included from 2017-18.\n\n    -   Each adult CC record represents a critical care period (from admission to discharge at a particular location)\n\n-   Outpatients (OP) - Collection of individual records of outpatient appointment in England. It includes information on:\n\n    -   Type of outpatient consultation\n\n    -   Appointment dates\n\n    -   Main specialty treatment specialty under which the patient was treated\n\n    -   Referral source\n\n    -   Waiting times\n\n-   Accident & Emergency (AE) - attendances recorded at major A&E departments, single specialty A&E departments, walk-in centres and minor injury units in England.\n\n    -   the Emergency Care dataset [ECDS](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-sets/emergency-care-data-set-ecds) has now replaced AE as the official source of emergency care data, as of April 2020.\n\n-   The HES-ONS linked mortality dataset is created by linking mortality data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to patient information in HES. The HES database captures information on deaths only if they occurred in hospital.\n\n## The case for HES in research\n\n## Considerations and issues of HES\n\n## Definition of an Episode and Spell\n\n-   Spell - Period of continuous care in one provider institution\n\n-   Episode - Periods of continuous care from a **single** consultant (as in one, we're not *too* concerned with the martial status of the good-looking physician who treated you).\n\n\\[Insert diagram of episodes within a spell\\]\n\nEach row in HES admitted patient care (APC) is a single episode which can be grouped into spells. A spell begins when a patient is admitted and ends when a patient has been discharges, transferred or dies.\n\n\\[example image of data frame\\]\n\nThings become increasingly complete when a patient is transferred to another NHS provider institution as a new spell is created with a new episode within it. For example,\n\n\\[insert image with CIP\\]\n\nHowever, a Continuous Inpatient Spell (CIP) is defined to encompass multiple spells.\n\nDiagnostic and procedure coding is entered by clinical coders written by the clinicians, when junior doctors are being trained they are reminded of the importance to get it correct on discharge summaries and to be clear on diagnosis of patients as there rules on what can/can't be coded. I.e., probable diabetes cannot be coded, only definitive diagnoses can be.\n\n## Examples of FCE's & Spells\n\n# Data Cleaning & Derived Variables\n\n## ID change - August 2021 Update\n\nData cleaning and Derivations can be found [here](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics/hospital-episode-statistics-data-dictionary). From 2021, the patient identified in HES (HESID) changed to Master Person Service (MPS).\n\n# Coding with HES\n\n[Data dictionary](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics/hospital-episode-statistics-data-dictionary)\n\n## Summary\n\n-   All FCE's in a spell will have the same admission date (`admidate`).\n\n-   `epistart` and `epiend` denote the start and end dates of an episode. `epiend` will be missing for unfinished episodes.\n\n-   `epiorder` denotes the order of episode within a spell\n\n-   `admimeth` denotes the admission method and is useful for determining which admissions are planned vs unplanned e.g. Elective (booked/waiting list), emergency, transferred from another hospital, delivery/new baby.\n\nAccording to the HES data analysis guide, it is recommended to remove unfinished episodes. The reason for this is, if you do not, you will have duplicates as unfinished episodes will also show in the next financial year as finished episodes. `epistat` is used to define an episode's status, a finished episode is coded using the `epistat = 3` meanwhile unfinished episodes are `epistat = 1` .\n\nVariables relating to discharge such as date (`disdate`), method (`dismeth`), destination (`disdest`), etc will only be recorded for the last episode of a spell. Therefore, if you wish to make this complete within a spell, you will need to perform some R trickery.\n\n## CIPS/Superspells\n\nAs briefly mentioned, a CIPS (also known as a superspell) is used to define one continuous period of care within NHS hospitals. An additional complexity when using this is the need to define transfers between hospitals. This can be done by looking at the admission date and discharge dates (allowing for possibly 1 day gap as they may be discharged/admitted around midnight on a given day which looks like a gap but isn't). Columns such as admission method `admimeth`, admission source `admisorc` and discharge destination `disdest` can be used to work out transfers.\n\nWhy is that important? It is more important if you're analysing your data at a hospital level as you will need to determine which hospital to attribute your outcomes to. A patient could have had a procedure at one hospital but recovering in another, for example.\n\nDocumentation into the methodology can be found [here](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20180307232845tf_/http://content.digital.nhs.uk/media/11859/Provider-Spells-Methodology/pdf/Spells_Methodology.pdf)\n\n## HES analysis steps\n\nHES analysis guide can be found [here](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics/users-uses-and-access-to-hospital-episode-statistics).\n\nSummary of steps:\n\n-   Initial data checks\n    -   Are all the requested variables in the data?\n    -   How much of the data is missing\n-   Data cleaning\n    -   Check date columns\n    -   Remove duplicates and unfinished episodes\n    -   Link admissions into spells/CIPS\n    -   If you're using linked data do a sense check e.g. Do rates over time make sense\n    -   Derive analysis variables\n-   Analyse results\n    -   Look at sensitivity analysis and tests robustness. I.e. results are not driven by odd artifacts resulting from the use of HES\n-   Validate\n    -   Ideally comparing to published data or experts (e.g. clinicians)\n\n## Small Numbers\n\nA small number in HES is defined as 1 - 5 which may allow for the identification of individual patients or a hospital consultant. When publishing or releasing HES data, cell values from 1-5 should be *omitted* to prevent possible identification. A note can be added at the bottom such as:\n\n::: {.callout-important .card .text-white .bg-secondary .mb-3 appearance=\"minimal\"}\n### Small Numbers table text\n\n\"\\* in this table denotes a figure between 1 and 5\"\n:::\n\nThe small numbers guidance also extends to restrictions on certain ICD/OPCS codings which are sensitive (e.g. Abortions, HIV, IVF, STI's). Advice should be sought from HSCIC if there are any doubts.\n\n# Useful Links\n\n-   [HES data and information (With data dictionary)](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics)\n\n-   [HES data analysis guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics/users-uses-and-access-to-hospital-episode-statistics)\n\n-   [Spell Methodology](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20180307232845tf_/http://content.digital.nhs.uk/media/11859/Provider-Spells-Methodology/pdf/Spells_Methodology.pdf)\n\n-   [HES processing and data quality checks](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics/hes-processing-cycle-and-data-quality-checks)\n\n-   [Secondary Uses Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/secondary-uses-service-sus)\n\n-   [National Cost Collection for the NHS](https://www.england.nhs.uk/costing-in-the-nhs/national-cost-collection/)\n\n-   [Linked HES-ONS mortality data](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/linked-hes-ons-mortality-data)\n\n-   [ICD-10 Version 2019 Coding](https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en)\n",
